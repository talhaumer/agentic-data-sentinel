# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. The following versions are currently supported:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Data Sentinel seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Open a Public Issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report via Email

Instead, please email us at: **security@datasentinel.ai**

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity

## Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Secrets

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use `.env` files locally (never commit them)

### Docker Security

- Run containers as non-root users
- Keep base images updated
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly
- Use secrets management for production

### Database Security

- Use strong passwords
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backups and encryption at rest

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories regularly
- Use Dependabot for automated security updates
- Run `pip audit` or `safety check` regularly

## Security Features

### Current Implementation

- âœ… Non-root container execution
- âœ… Security headers in Nginx
- âœ… Rate limiting on API endpoints
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization
- âœ… CORS configuration
- âœ… Environment-based secrets management

### Planned Enhancements

- ðŸ”„ JWT authentication
- ðŸ”„ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ðŸ”„ API key management
- ðŸ”„ Audit logging
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end encryption

## Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are maintained
- [ ] Authentication/authorization is implemented where needed
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitize outputs)

## Known Security Considerations

### Development Environment

- The development environment uses default credentials
- Debug mode exposes additional information
- Development server should never be exposed to the internet

### Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. Change all default passwords
2. Enable HTTPS/TLS
3. Configure firewall rules
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Implement backup and disaster recovery
6. Review and restrict CORS origins
7. Enable rate limiting
8. Use strong secret keys

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

1. **Report** received and acknowledged
2. **Assessment** of severity and impact
3. **Fix** developed and tested
4. **Patch** released to supported versions
5. **Disclosure** published after fix is available

## Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:
